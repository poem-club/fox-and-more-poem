I think I know.
Its owner is quite happy though.
Full of joy 
like a vivid rainbow.
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink.
It's in her dream. 

She gives her rabbit a shake,
and laughs until her belly aches.
The only other sound's the break
of ditant waves and rabbits awake.

The fox is curious, oragne, and deep,
But she has promises to keep, 
After cake and lots of sleep,
Sweet dreams come to her.
